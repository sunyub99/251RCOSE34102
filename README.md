ðŸ§  OS Scheduling Algorithm Simulator
A lightweight C-language simulator for visualizing and comparing classic CPU Scheduling Algorithms used in Operating Systems.
Perfect for educational purposes, operating systems coursework, and hands-on simulations.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Support for 6 major scheduling algorithms:

1. FCFS (First-Come First-Serve)
2. SJF (Shortest Job First) - Non-Preemptive
3. SJF (Shortest Remaining Time First) - Preemptive
4. Priority Scheduling - Non-Preemptive
5. Priority Scheduling - Preemptive
6. Round Robin (with configurable time quantum)

Two modes for process creation:

1. Manual input
2. Random generation

Gantt chart visualization for each algorithm

Automatic calculation of:

1. Waiting Time
2. Turnaround Time
3. Completion Time

Comparative performance analysis across all algorithms
